# McLean Fluids

Run computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations anywhere! McLean-Fluids is a CFD library written in rust. It is intended to be run anywhere, though currently I am specifically targeting webassembly (wasm) so I can run it on my [personal website](https://ben-mclean-software.com).

This project is educational and intended to help me learn rust. I want to learn more about systems languages, and so far I like rust the most. I am going to write tests for everything, have a CI/CD pipeline, and publish to npm. If this project turns out to be useful I will look into building for other systems and publishing elsewhere.

If you think this project would be useful to you and you would like a feature added [create an issue](https://github.com/BenMcLean981/mclean-fluids/issues)!
